read_vhdl

Description: 
Read one or more VHDL files

Syntax: 
read_vhdl  -library <arg> [-vhdl2008] [-vhdl2019] [-quiet] [-verbose] <files>

Returns: 
list of file objects that were added

Usage: 
  Name         Description
  ------------------------
  -library     VHDL library
  [-vhdl2008]  VHDL file is version 2008.
  [-vhdl2019]  VHDL file is version 2019.
  [-quiet]     Ignore command errors
  [-verbose]   Suspend message limits during command execution
  <files>      VHDL file name(s)

Categories: 
FileIO

Description:

  Reads VHDL source files. This command is similar to the add_files command.
  The VHDL files are added to the source fileset as the file is read. If the
  -library argument is specified, the file is added with the Library property
  defined.

  You can use this command to read the contents of source files into the
  in-memory design, when running the AMD Vivado Design Suite tool in Non
  Project mode, in which there is no project file to maintain and manage the
  various project source files. Refer to the Vivado Design Suite User Guide:
  Design Flows Overview (UG892) for more information on Non Project mode.

Arguments:

  -library <arg> - (Optional) The library the VHDL file should reference. The
  default VHDL library is xil_defaultlib.

  -vhdl2008 - (Optional) Identifies the files to be read as VHDL file version
  2008.

  -vhdl2019 - (Optional) Identifies the files to be read as VHDL file version
  2019.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <files> - (Required) Names of one or more VHDL files to be read.

  Note: If the path is not specified as part of the file name, the tool will
  search for the specified file in the current working directory and then in
  the directory from which the tool was launched.

Examples:

  The following example reads the specified VHDL file and adds it to the
  source fileset:

    read_vhdl C:/Data/FPGA_Design/new_module.vhdl

  This example reads multiple specified VHDL 2008 files:

    read_vhdl -vhdl2008 {file1.vhd file2.vhd file3.vhd}

  This example reads multiple specified VHDL 2019 files:

    read_vhdl -vhdl2019 {file1.vhd file2.vhd file3.vhd}
