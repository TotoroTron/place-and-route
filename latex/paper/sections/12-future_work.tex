\section{Future Work}
In this paper we have made many simplifications to the problem space just to make the placer easier to implement.
For example, our placer in its current state does not take advantage of \texttt{SLICEL}/\texttt{SLICEM} homogeneity and simply maps all SLICE \texttt{SiteInst}s onto \texttt{SLICEL}s. 
Recall that the SLICE Sites in Xilinx FPGAs typically come in a 75-25\% split between \texttt{SLICEL}s and \texttt{SLICEM}s. 
This means that we have rendered about 25\% of the CLB fabric unusable which will inevitably hurt wirelength minimization during placement since the \texttt{SiteInst}s must be spread over a larger area. 

There is also no rule saying we must pack \texttt{Cells} into \texttt{SiteInst}s before placement or that we follow a strict prepacking-packing-placement flow. 

The latest editions of Vivado performs BEL-centric placement without necessarily locking \texttt{Cell}s into \texttt{Site}s, allowing a higher granularity of movement of \texttt{Cell}s during placement.
