\label{sec:placement}
Up until now, we have only dealt with technology problems where we consider the problem space and adress the constraints of the hardware architecture. 
For every constraint, we devise a solution or a simplification that sacrifices some optimization to reduce the complexity of the problem space. 

Now that we have dealt with the bulk of the Cell-BEL level constraints and squared them away into self-contained \texttt{SiteInst}s, we can now apply some well-known optimization algorithms to finally address our optimization objective, which is to place these \texttt{SiteInst}s onto the device in a way that minimizes wirelength. 

In this paper we implement and present a Simulating Annealing (SA) placer that operates at the \texttt{SiteInst} level.
