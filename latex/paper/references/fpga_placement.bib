    abstract = {VLSI placement optimizes locations of circuit components so as to reduce interconnect. Formulated in terms of (hyper) graphs, it is NP-hard, and yet must be solved for challenging million-node instances within several hours. We propose an algorithm for large-scale placement that outperforms prior art both in runtime and solution quality on standard benchmarks. The algorithm is more straightforward than existing placers and easier to integrate into timing-closure flows. Our C++ implementation is compact, self-contained and exploits instruction-level and thread-level parallelism. Due to its simplicity and superior performance, the algorithm has been adopted in the industry and was extended by several university groups to multi-objective optimization.},
