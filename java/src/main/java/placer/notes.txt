net i_rst_IBUF can be fully routed via the interactive router.
however, route_design will not route it.
possibly it first attempts to route the leaf (lowest) level nets first

we are now encountering the limitations of the vivado router in digesting our random placement...

Unroutable connection Types:
----------------------------
    Type 1 : SLICEL.AQ->SLICEL.CE


Is this a generic statement for all AQ-CE?
Why can't the output of a flip-flop drive the CE of another flip-flop?
    => not true, some CLBs CEs are correctly routed, so wtf?

either some pins are not meant to be connected, 
OR,
switchboxes are to congested to connect them (very unlikely for a design using less than 2% of total CLBs).

TURNS OUT:
    Using only default route_design tcl command allows the CE sitepin's port on the switchbox to get "stolen" by LUT sitepins.
    Using the interactive router, unrouting the LUT sitepin thief, routing the CE net, the rerouting the LUT sitepin at another switchbox port solves the routing error completely.
    Each LUT input pin has many ports on the switchbox.
    CE pin only has one port on the switchbox, so it should be given higher priority.
    Need to use route_design -nets <args> to force it to route Flip Flop nets before routing LUT nets.

===> don't reset signals to 1'b1. this will cause synth to infer FDSE instead of FDRE!
    java currently does not know how to place FDSE
