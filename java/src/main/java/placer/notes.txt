net i_rst_IBUF can be fully routed via the interactive router.
however, route_design will not route it.
possibly it first attempts to route the leaf (lowest) level nets first

we are now encountering the limitations of the vivado router in digesting our random placement...

Unroutable connection Types:
----------------------------
    Type 1 : SLICEL.AQ->SLICEL.CE


Is this a generic statement for all AQ-CE?
Why can't the output of a flip-flop drive the CE of another flip-flop?
    => not true, some CLBs CEs are correctly routed, so wtf?

either some pins are not meant to be connected, 
OR,
switchboxes are to congested to connect them (very unlikely for a design using less than 2% of total CLBs).
